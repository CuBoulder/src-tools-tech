# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a [stylesheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/stylesheet) language used to describe the presentation of a document written in [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) or [XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XML_introduction) (including XML dialects such as [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG), [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) or [XHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XHTML)). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

CSS is one of the core languages of the open Web and is standardized across Web browsers according to the [W3C specification](http://w3.org/Style/CSS/#specs). Developed in levels, CSS1 is now obsolete, CSS2.1 is a recommendation, and [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3), now split into smaller modules, is progressing on the standardization track.

## Selectors and how they work

In [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS), selectors are used to target the [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML) elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style.
